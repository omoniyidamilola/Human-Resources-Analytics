# Human Resources Analytics

## Introduction

Human Resources (HR) refers to the department within an organization responsible for managing the personnel or workforce. It is essential for ensuring that an organization has the right talent, adheres to legal and ethical standards, and fosters a positive and productive work environment. The role of Human Resources has evolved over the years to encompass strategic functions, aligning Human Resources practices with an organization's overall goals and objectives.

Human Resources analytics is the application of data analysis and data visualization techniques to Human Resources data in order to gain insights and make data-driven decisions related to the workforce. It involves collecting, processing, and analyzing Human Resources data to improve Human Resources processes, talent management, and overall organizational performance.

Human Resources analytics leverages data from various Human Resources functions, such as recruitment, employee engagement, performance management, compensation and benefits, and employee turnover, to answer critical questions and address challenges within an organization.
